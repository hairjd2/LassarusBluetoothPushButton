- Added more to the profile page so that it globally stores the name of the patient.
- Setup a list so that I can list out the devices so the patient can determine what device to connect to
- Might just have it so that they have to connect manually to the device and I can just read from it
- Struggled a bit with figuring out how to list the scanned devices as well as trying out example versions as they are not up to date
- Plan to start working on firebase implementation after bluetooth is being read from.
